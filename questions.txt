What are the methods to reduce spatial input size in CNNs? [Stride + The primary function of the POOL layer is to progressively reduce the spatial size (i.e., width
and height) of the input volume. Doing this allows us to reduce the amount of parameters and
computation in the network – pooling also helps us control overfitting.] (p.189 )
[
    This result is in contrast to when we set decay=0.01 / 40 (right) and obtain a much nicer
learning plot (and not to mention, higher accuracy). By using learning rate decay we can often not
only improve our classification accuracy but also lessen the effects of overfitting, thereby increasing
the ability of our model to generalize

Pooling (p.188) [note: In their 2014 paper, Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net, Springenberg et al. [127]

stride to handle downsampling the spatial dimensions of the volume.]

What are the characteristics of a vggnet
[
    The VGG family of Convolutional Neural Networks can be characterized by two key components:
    1. All CONV layers in the network using only 33 filters.
    2. Stacking multiple CONV => RELU layer sets (where the number of consecutive CONV =>
RELU layers normally increases the deeper we go) before applying a POOL operation.
]
Why is it wise to use pooling layers deeper or not at all? What are the disatvantages of a pooling layer?
[
    In both ShallowNet and LeNet we have applied a series of CONV => RELU => POOL layers. However,
in VGGNet, we stack multiple CONV => RELU layers prior to applying a single POOL layer.
Doing this allows the network to learn more rich features from the CONV layers prior to downsampling
the spatial input size via the POOL operation.
]
What are the advantages of learning rate schedulers?
[
    Instead, what we can do is decrease our
learning rate, thereby allowing our network to take smaller steps – this decreased rate enables
our network to descend into areas of the loss landscape that are "more optimal" and would have
otherwise been missed entirely by our larger learning rate.
]
What is weight scheduling and when is it applied?
[
    We can, therefore, view the process of learning rate scheduling as:
1. Finding a set of reasonably “good” weights early in the training process with a higher learning
rate.
2. Tuning these weights later in the process to find more optimal weights using a smaller
learning rate.
