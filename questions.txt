What are the methods to reduce spatial input size in CNNs? [Stride + The primary function of the POOL layer is to progressively reduce the spatial size (i.e., width
and height) of the input volume. Doing this allows us to reduce the amount of parameters and
computation in the network – pooling also helps us control overfitting.] (p.189 )
[
    This result is in contrast to when we set decay=0.01 / 40 (right) and obtain a much nicer
learning plot (and not to mention, higher accuracy). By using learning rate decay we can often not
only improve our classification accuracy but also lessen the effects of overfitting, thereby increasing
the ability of our model to generalize

What are the characteristics of a vggnet
[
    The VGG family of Convolutional Neural Networks can be characterized by two key components:
    1. All CONV layers in the network using only 33 filters.
    2. Stacking multiple CONV => RELU layer sets (where the number of consecutive CONV =>
RELU layers normally increases the deeper we go) before applying a POOL operation.
]
Why is it wise to use pooling layers deeper or not at all? What are the disatvantages of a pooling layer?
[
    In both ShallowNet and LeNet we have applied a series of CONV => RELU => POOL layers. However,
in VGGNet, we stack multiple CONV => RELU layers prior to applying a single POOL layer.
Doing this allows the network to learn more rich features from the CONV layers prior to downsampling
the spatial input size via the POOL operation.
]
What are the advantages of learning rate schedulers?
[
    Instead, what we can do is decrease our
learning rate, thereby allowing our network to take smaller steps – this decreased rate enables
our network to descend into areas of the loss landscape that are "more optimal" and would have
otherwise been missed entirely by our larger learning rate.
]
What is weight scheduling and when is it applied?
[
    We can, therefore, view the process of learning rate scheduling as:
1. Finding a set of reasonably “good” weights early in the training process with a higher learning
rate.
2. Tuning these weights later in the process to find more optimal weights using a smaller
learning rate.

How would you calculate the weight decay? (p. 242)
What Are Underfitting and Overfitting? {p.251-2}
[
    In this chapter we reviewed underfitting and overfitting. Underfitting occurs when your model
is unable to obtain sufficiently low loss on the training set. Meanwhile, overfitting occurs when
the gap between your training loss and validation loss is too large, indicating that the network is
modeling the underlying patterns in the training data too strong.

Explain the haar cascade algorithm
[
    The Haar cascade algorithm is capable of detecting objects in images, regardless of their
location and scale. Perhaps most intriguing (and relevant to our application), the detector can run
in real-time on modern hardware. In fact, the motivation of behind Viola and Jones’ work was to
create a face detector.
]
What is the difference between haar cascade and hog?
What is data augmentation {PB: 15}
What types of image augmentation do you know?
Why do you use aumentation?
{
    However, as we’ll find out later in this chapter, data augmentation can help dramatically reduce
overfitting, all the while ensuring that our model generalizes better to new input samples. Furthermore,
when working with datasets where we have too few examples to apply deep learning, we
can utilize data augmentation to generate additional training data, thereby reducing the amount of
hand-labeled data required to train a deep learning network.
}
What types of transfer learning do you know?
{
    In general, there are two types of transfer learning when applied to deep learning for computer
vision:
1. Treating networks as arbitrary feature extractors. [add picture PB p.35] -> What is a feature extractor
2. Removing the fully-connected layers of an existing network, placing new FC layer set on
top of the CNN, and fine-tuning these weights (and optionally previous layers) to recognize
object classes.
}
What is HDF5 and how is the data stored there? {PB p. 35}
What is rank-1, rank-5, and rank-N accuracy? And how do they differ from the traditional
accuracy (i.e., precision)?
{
    Rank-1 accuracy is, therefore, the percentage of
predictions where the top prediction matches the ground-truth label – this is the “standard” type of
accuracy we are used to computing: take the total number of correct predictions and divide it by
the number of data points in the dataset.
1. Step #1: Computing the class label probabilities for each input image in the dataset.
2. Step #2: Determining if the ground-truth label is equal to the predicted class label with the
largest probability.
3. Step #3: Tallying the number of times where Step #2 is true.

We can then extend this concept to rank-5 accuracy. Instead of caring only about the number
one prediction, we care about the top-5 predictions. Our evaluation process now becomes:
1. Step #1: Compute the class label probabilities for each input image in the dataset.
2. Step #2: Sort the predicted class label probabilities in descending order, such that labels
with higher probability are placed at the front of the list.
3. Step #3: Determine if the ground-truth label exists in the top-5 predicted labels from Step
#2.
4. Step #4: Tally the number of times where Step #3 is true.
Rank-5 is simply an extension to rank-1 accuracy: instead of caring about only the #1 prediction
from the classifier, we’ll take into account the top-5 predictions from the network.
}

{
    infos to network surgery. PB 68. First, freeze basemodel and train the head for 30-40 epochs. Then unfreeze the last conv layer. If classification accuracy continues to
improve (without overfitting), you may want to consider unfreezing more layers in the body.
At this point we should have a warm start to training, so we’ll switch over to SGD (again with
a small learning rate) and continue training. Train for about 100 epochs.
}
what is Jensen’s Inequality?
what is the difference between voting and averaging in decision trees?
{
    Dietterich’s work hinges on Jensen’s Inequality, which is known as the “diversity” or the
“ambiguity decomposition” in machine learning literature. The formal definition of Jensen’s
Inequality states that the convex combined (average) ensemble will have error less than or equal to
the average error of the individual models. It may be that one individual model has a lower error
than the average of all models, but since there is no criterion that we can use to “select” this model,
we can be assured that the average of all models will perform no worse than selecting any single
model at random. In short, we can only get better by averaging our predictions together; we don’t
have to fear making our classifier worse.
}
How many models do you train in ensemble learning for image recognition or classification?
{
    we normally only see 5-10
Convolutional Neural Networks in an ensemble – the reason is due to the fact that CNNs are much
more time-consuming and computationally expensive to train
}
Somthing about ensembles?
{
    It’s important to note that we would never jump straight to training an ensemble – we would
first run a series of experiments to determine which combination of architecture, optimizer, and
hyperparameters yields the highest accuracy on a given dataset.
Once you’ve reached this optimal set of combination, we would then switch over to training
multiple models to form an ensemble. Training an ensemble as your very first experiment is considered
premature optimization as you don’t know what combination of architecture, optimizer, and
hyperparameters will work best for your given dataset.

}
Why have all state-of-the-art architectures been trained with SGD and not with ADAM?
{
    But why is this? We can clearly see the benefits in algorithms that apply adaptive learning rates
such as RMSprop and Adam – networks can converge faster. However, the speed of convergence,
while important, is not the most important factor – hyperparameters still win out. If you cannot
tune the hyperparameters to a given optimizer (and associated model), your network will never
obtain reasonable accuracy.

How many data samples per class should we usually have?
{
    1000 - 5000

Notes to transfer learning in PB S. 96
Why is loading images in batches ineffvicient and what is the alternative?
What means the option "stratify" in train_test_split?
HDF5 infos:
{
    For example, if we defined a dataset generator that loaded images sequentially from disk, we
would need N read operations, one for each image. However, by placing our dataset of images
into an HDF5 dataset, we can instead load batches of images using a single read. This action
dramatically reduces the number of I/O calls and allows us to work with very large image datasets.
}
What was the problem with AlexNet in Chapter 9 of SB?
How can GoogLenet go so deep without getting lost in the parameters?
What is special about GoogLeNet?
{
First, the model architecture is tiny compared to AlexNet and VGGNet ( 28MB for the weights
themselves). The authors are able to obtain such a dramatic drop in network architecture size (while
still increasing the depth of the overall network) by removing fully-connected layers and instead
using global average pooling. Most of the weights in a CNN can be found in the dense FC layers –
if these layers can be removed, the memory savings are massive.
Secondly, the Szegedy et al. paper makes usage of a network in network or micro-architecture
when constructing the overall macro-architecture. Up to this point, we have seen only sequential
neural networks where the output of one network feeds directly into the next. We are now going
to see micro-architectures, small building blocks that are used inside the rest of the architecture,
where the output from one layer can split into a number of various paths and be rejoined later.
Specifically, Szegedy et al. contributed the Inception module to the deep learning community, a
building block that fits into a Convolutional Neural Network enabling it to learn CONV layers with
multiple filter sizes, turning the module into a multi-level feature extractor.
