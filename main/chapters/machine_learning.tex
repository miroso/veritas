\subsection{Explaing bagging}
Known more formally as Bootstrapped Aggregation is where the same algorithm has different perspectives on the problem by being trained on different subsets of the training data.

\subsection{Explaing boosting}
Different algorithms are trained on the same training data.

\subsection{Explaing blending}
Known more formally as Stacked Generalization or Stacking is where a variety of models whose predictions are taken as input to a new model that learns how to combine the predictions into an overall prediction.
