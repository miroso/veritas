\section{Cmder}

\subsection{How do you change lambda promt?}
On windows, if you are using anaconda, there might be a problem with activating virtualenv, since conda does't not recognize the lambda character. Thus you have to change the lambda character in the cmder as follows:

\vspace{4mm}

\begin{lstlisting}
vim vendor/git-for-windows/etc/profile.d/git-prompt.sh
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{How do you handle virtual environment in anaconda}
\begin{lstlisting}
    # create virtual environment
    conda create -n myenv python=3.4

    # activate the virtual environment
    # windows
    source activate myenv

    # deactivate the virtual environment
    conda deactivate

    # print all virtual environments
    # * indicates the active one
    conda info --envs

    # delete virtual environment
    conda remove --name myenv --all
\end{lstlisting}

        \item Program: \$PyInterpreterDirectory\$\textbackslash pylint.exe
        \item Arguments: -v --rcfile=.pylintrc "--msg-template='{abspath}:{line:5d},{column:2d}: {msg} ({symbol})'" --output-format=colorized "\$FilePath\$"
        \item Working directory: \$ProjectFileDir\$
        \item Advanced Options
        \begin{itemize}

%         \item Program: $PyInterpreterDirectory$\yapf.exe
%         \item Arguments: --style=yapf.conf -i "$FilePath$"
%         \item Working directory: $ProjectFileDir$
%         \item Advanced Options
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item Syncronize files after execution: True
%             \item Open Console for tool Output: True
%         \end{itemize}
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{enumerate}



If you don't want to replace the code in-place remove the -i argument and add another config for that (Lächeln)
