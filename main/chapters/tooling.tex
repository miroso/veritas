\section{Cmder}

\subsection{How do you change lambda promt?}
On windows, if you are using anaconda, there might be a problem with activating virtualenv, since conda does't not recognize the lambda character. Thus you have to change the lambda character in the cmder as follows:

In cmder folder:
vim vendor/git-for-windows/etc/profile.d/git-prompt.sh

\subsection{How do you handle virtual environment in anaconda}
\begin{lstlisting}
    # create virtual environment
    conda create -n myenv python=3.4

    # activate the virtual environment
    # windows
    source activate myenv

    # deactivate the virtual environment
    conda deactivate

    # print all virtual environments
    # * indicates the active one
    conda info --envs

    # delete virtual environment
    conda remove --name myenv --all
\end{lstlisting}
