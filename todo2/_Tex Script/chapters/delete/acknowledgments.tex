\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I especially would like to thank Thomas Euler for allowing me to do my master thesis in his lab, and to Tom Baden for his great help and supervision. Further, I would like to give my gratitude to all lab members, including Katrin Franke, Tanja Grau, Robin Kemmler, Manoj Kulkarni and Timm Schubert, and to Gordon Eske for his excellent technical assistance.
